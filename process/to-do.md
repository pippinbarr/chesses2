# General to-dos

- Add an information window to explain any given game

# The variations

## REVERSAL

- ~~Make basic working version~~

- Think about check and checkmate
- What happens if you move a king?

## FOG

- ~~Make a shitty prototype~~
- ~~Make a better prototype~~

## LIFE

- ~~Shitty prototype~~
- ~~__SUSPECT THIS IS BETTER__ Try step per turn (after turn completes)~~

- Different values? It's really not working terribly well. DisapPOINTed.

## XR (Cross-Reality)

- ~~__THAT WAS EASY__ Make a perfect first version~~

## MUSICAL

- ~~__SOUNDS SHIT__ Basic tone matrix prototype~~

- Square by square for a melody, with per-piece tones? Per color synths?

## TRACES / LEWITT

- ~~Get a basic prototype working~~
- ~~__IT'S GREAT__ Consider p5.scribble~~
- ~~__NO NEED__ Consider writing your own line-drawing code with noise()~~

- Fix pixel density of saved image?
- Provide the option to save rather than doing it instantly (since on my phone at least it leads to just a weird screen with the image and it's unclear how to save it)

## SAMSARA

- ~~Make basic working version~~

- Think about check and checkmate
- What happens if you move a king?

## 3D

- ~~__YUP, THAT WORKS I GUESS.__ Make a prototype~~

## CHESSQUERS/DRAUGHTS

- ~~__IT'S KIND OF HARD BUT WORTH DOING__ Start prototype and see if it's super hard or not~~

- Improve prototype to display actual destination square, not capture square
- Deal with knights
- En passant???
- Other weird shit???

## ABRAHAM / I CUT YOU CHOOSE

- Starting to feel like this one just doesn't work...? Like, whichever way it might lead to super boring games. If you choose the piece for your opponent you'll obviously just choose useless pieces. If you choose the move you'll obviously just choose the worst move. So you'd end up with just a bad game since neither side of the equation really give decisive good/bad control over the game. Sad.
