# Process documentation

This is the process documentation for the game _Chesses 2_. The process documentation available here is the result of following the [MDMA](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma) (Method for Design Materialisation and Analysis), an approach to game design recoverability that forms the basis of the [Games as Research](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/) project I am part of with [Rilla Khaled](http://www.rillakhaled.com/) and [Jonathan Lessard](https://jonathanlessard.net/).

### Closing Statement (tbd)
A final, hopefully-accessible discussion of the game with hindsight.

### [Process Journal](./process-journal.md)
